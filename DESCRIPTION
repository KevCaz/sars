Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Thomas J.", "Matthews", email = "txm676@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre")),
            person("FranÃ§ois", "Guilhaumon", email = "francois.guilhaumon@ird.fr",
                  role = c("aut")))
Description: Implements the basic elements of the multi-model 
    inference paradigm (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) with simple R list-objects 
    and functions. The package is scalable and users can easily create their own model and data objects.
