Title: Fit and compare species-area relationship models using multimodel inference
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: c(person("Thomas J.", "Matthews", email = "txm676@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre")),
            person("FranÃ§ois", "Guilhaumon", email = "francois.guilhaumon@ird.fr",
                  role = c("aut")))
Description: Implements the basic elements of the multi-model 
    inference paradigm (Burnham & Anderson, 2002) for up to twenty species-area relationship models (SAR),
    using simple R list-objects and functions. The package is scalable and users can easily create their 
    own model and data objects. Additional SAR related functions are provided.
