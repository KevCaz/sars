> *fit and compare **Species-Area Relationship (SAR)** models using multi-model inference*

**sars** provides functionality to fit twenty SAR model using non-linear regression, and to calculate multi-model averaged curves using various information criteria. The software also provides easy to use functionality to plot multi-model SAR curves and to generate confidence intervals using bootstrapping.

As this is version 1.0.0 of the package, it is possible that there are some bugs in places. Please report any
issues to us via GitHub.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sars from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sars")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("txm676/sars")
```
## Example usage

Basic usage of **sars** will result in using two types of functions:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(sars)
```

To fit the power sar model [@Arrhenius1921] to the 'galapagos' [@Preston1962] data set:
```{r}
fit_pow <- sar_power(data = galap)
```

Attempting to fit all 20 sar models to the 'galapagos' [@Preston1962] data set and get a multi-model SAR:
```{r warning = FALSE}
mm_galap <- sar_multi(data = galap)
```

Most of 'fitted' objects have corresponding plot methods:

to fit the exponential SAR model [@Gleason1922] to the 'galapagos' data set and plot it
```{r}
fit_expo <- sar_expo(data = galap)

plot(fit_expo)
```

## Troubleshoutting

If, despite the :heart: brought during the programming of this R :package: and writing of this documentation, you have difficulties to install or run sars, if you have questions about the procedures or calculations, or if you want to report bugs :beetle:, do not hesitate to connect with us on [GitHub](https://github.com/txm676/sars).
